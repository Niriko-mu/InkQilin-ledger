## Features

### Core

- **Transaction Management** — Quickly add income/expense entries with custom amounts, notes, categories, and dates
- **Amount Keypad Arithmetic** — Edit and add-transaction amount input supports `+ − × ÷` and parentheses (e.g. `(20+5)×2`), with backspace, clear, and live preview
- **Multi-Currency Support** — Manage multiple currencies with customizable card colors, symbols, and names; switch default currency anytime
- **Monthly Overview Card** — Displays total income, expense, and net balance for the selected month with a year-month picker
- **7-Day Trend Chart** — Visual bar chart of daily spending over the past week
- **Category System** — Built-in categories for income and expenses; create custom categories with icons and colors
- **Bill Editing** — Swipe left on any transaction to reveal edit/delete options; modify amount, note, type, category, and date
- **Statistics** — View spending by week, month, year, or custom date range (inclusive of both start and end dates); drill down by category; period-over-period comparison with daily average
- **Asset Management** — Track assets across 8 types (real estate, stocks, funds, bonds, deposits, insurance, crypto, other); view totals and breakdowns by type
- **Search** — Search transactions by keyword

### AI & Lab Features

- **AI Financial Analysis** (Smart Mode only) — Automated daily analysis of spending patterns; displays a financial score (0-100) and up to 3 consumption alerts on the home screen
- **OCR Batch Recognition** — Upload bill images (batch supported) for AI vision model recognition; auto-extracts date, amount, category, and note for one-tap import
- **Separate API Configuration** — Independent API settings for OCR and analysis, with a one-tap sync button between them
- **Auto Bookkeeping** — Monitors Alipay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay notifications; auto-parses and records transactions with deduplication
- **Smart Keyword Classification** — 50+ built-in keyword rules (e.g. "takeout" -> Dining, "Didi" -> Transport); add/edit/delete custom rules
- **Ad Filtering** — Automatically detects and filters non-transaction notifications (ads, marketing, coupons) from payment apps
- **Zero-Amount Filtering** — Ignores 0-amount notifications to avoid invalid records

### Social Gift Ledger (RenQing)

- **Event Recording** — Track weddings, funerals, birthdays, housewarming, graduations, baby showers, and more
- **Direction Tracking** — Mark gifts as "received" or "given"; auto-calculates net amounts
- **Contact Management** — Maintain a contact list with relationship categories (family, friend, colleague)
- **Tag System** — Custom tags (e.g. family, school, workplace) with icons and colors
- **Annual Dashboard** — Yearly income/expense/net summary with monthly breakdowns
- **Tag & Contact Analytics** — View gift distribution by tag and contact rankings
- **Excel Export** — Export gift records and contacts by time range

### Data Management & Backup

- **Flexible Export** — Export transactions by "All / This Year / Custom Range" for both ledgers
- **Excel Export** — One-tap export to Excel with custom save location
- **Template Download** — Download a pre-formatted template for bulk import
- **Smart Import** — Import from Excel; auto-creates missing categories
- **Local Backup** — Pack the Room database into a zip under the app-private directory; export to system storage, restore, or delete from history
- **Cloud Backup (Tencent COS)** — Private read/write COS: configure SecretId/SecretKey and bucket URL, then upload/list/restore/delete backups
- **Optional Password Encryption** — Backups can be encrypted with AES-256-GCM (key via PBKDF2-HmacSHA256); encrypted restores require the password
- **Hard Delete** — Local backups are overwritten before unlink; cloud deletes are verified as gone; home-screen bills use hard delete with SQLite `secure_delete` to reduce residual recovery from the DB file
- **Safe Exit After Restore** — After restore, a dialog offers one-tap force-close so the app reloads the new database

### General

- **App Mode Toggle** — Basic Mode (privacy-focused, local-only) and Smart Mode (AI-powered analysis, financial scoring, consumption alerts)
- **Theme Customization** — Light mode (#715CFF purple) / Dark mode (#51B4FF blue); follows system setting
- **Custom Colors** — Customize income/expense display colors across all views
- **Immersive UI** — Full-screen layout with transparent status and navigation bars
- **Update Checker** — Optional startup check against the latest Gitee Release, plus a manual “Check for updates” action in Settings; view changelog and download via Gitee / GitHub / proxy
- **Configurable Update Repos** — Point the update checker at any Gitee repository and set the GitHub download repository (`owner/repo` or full URL); both settings are persisted
- **Settings State Kept** — Expanded/collapsed settings sections survive navigation to secondary screens and back
- **About (Top-Level)** — Dedicated settings section with version info, Gitee/GitHub links, and a usage guide
